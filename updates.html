                    <h4>December</h4>
                    <p>Kyempapu's Board validated and approved the Strategic Plan to be launched in Dec 2020. Below are photos from a workshop that took place between 3-5th November at Maria Flo Hotel in Masaka financed by GIZ-CUSP. Kyempapu also has face masks for the organization.</p>

                    <h4>November</h4>
                    <p>1) Kyempapu is implementing a covid 19 change project to help prevent the spread of covid19 at public water sources through radio talks, education, and fencing. This project is supported  by GIZ-CUSP, the German Government and the European Union.</p>

                    <p>2) Kyempapu is promoting the use of energy efficient stoves, which only require 3 pieces of wood to prepare a meal. We are still in need partners in the energy saving sector so that we can reduce on the number of trees being cut.</p>
                    
                    
                     <p>3) Kyempapu received Water Drilling equipment from its US partners. These will be useful in helping to address water challenges in the community and district.</p>
                    
                   <p>4) A training on bio sand filter making has been conducted and concluded at Kyempapu. Thank you CAWST for the support! This is another step taken to promote safe drinking water into the community.</p>

                    <p>Kyempapu  participated in a stakeholder survey to find out the relevancy of its work in the community and areas to be improved in the next 5 years. This is one of the processes in the implementation of the strategic plan development for Kyempapu supported by the Germany international cooperation (GIZ) under the Civil society in Uganda support program (CUSP). In August, Kyempapu organised and coordinated  a Household Water Training for Trainers  and a Water Treatment and safe Storage workshop with facilitators from Calgary, Canada.</p>
